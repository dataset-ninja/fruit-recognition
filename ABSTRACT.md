In the pursuit of accurate detection and recognition of fruits and vegetables, the authors of the **Fruit Recognition** dataset acknowledge the persistent challenges posed by the similarities between various fruit types and the complexities of real-world environments, including lighting and background variations.
The dataset consists of 44,406 fruit images gathered over a span of 6 months. These images were taken within our laboratory's controlled environment under various conditions, as elaborated below. All images were captured against a clear background with a resolution of 320×258 pixels, using an HD Logitech webcam for photography.

In the current era, traditional bar code technology continues to be used in fruit shops and supermarkets for price and source traceback information. Managing individual bar codes for various fruit categories poses challenges for shopkeepers. The authors highlight the significance of machine learning-based algorithms in object detection and recognition, particularly in addressing the preference of customers to select fruits individually rather than opting for prepackaged ones.

Images of fruits were captured using an HD Logitech web camera at a resolution of 200 × 200 pixels. The data collection process confronted various challenges, including lighting variations, pose changes, camera artifacts, and shadows. The authors employed the split-and-merge algorithm to remove image backgrounds. To ensure model robustness, the dataset incorporated images with diverse illumination conditions, capture artifacts, specular reflections, and shadows, akin to real-world scenarios in supermarkets and fruit shops. The dataset further enhanced realism by featuring images taken at different times and days. The authors encountered substantial diversity in image quality and lighting. Data samples displayed environmental variations, adding complexity to the dataset. The authors emphasize the importance of a substantial dataset for effective deep learning algorithm training, particularly in cases where fruits share color and size similarities.

<i>Note, that this is a newer version of the dataset and actual number of images and their resolution differ from what was described in the paper.</i>
